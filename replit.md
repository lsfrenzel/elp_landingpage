## System Architecture

### Z-Index Management
- **Hero Section**: z-index: 1 (background layer)
- **Content Sections**: z-index: 5 (ensures content appears above hero during scroll)
- **Hero Text Elements**: z-index: 10 (highest priority for visibility)
- **Navigation Bar**: Fixed positioning with appropriate z-index

### Frontend Architecture
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Built as a responsive landing page with multiple sections accessible through smooth scrolling navigation
- **Bootstrap Framework**: Uses Bootstrap 5.3.0 for responsive grid system and components
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Implements CSS variables for consistent theming with company colors (primary blue #00264d, cement gray #cccccc, white)
- **Typography**: Uses Montserrat font family from Google Fonts for modern, professional appearance
- **JavaScript Enhancement**: Custom JavaScript for smooth scrolling, navbar effects, form validation, and animations

### Backend Architecture
- **Flask Microframework**: Lightweight Python web framework serving static content and handling form submissions
- **Template Engine**: Uses Jinja2 templating (Flask's default) for HTML generation
- **Flash Messaging System**: Implements Flask's flash messaging for user feedback on form submissions
- **Error Handling**: Custom 404 error handler (incomplete in current code)
- **Environment Configuration**: Uses environment variables for session secrets

### Form Processing
- **Contact Form Handler**: Server-side validation for contact form submissions with Portuguese language feedback
